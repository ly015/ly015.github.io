I am a researcher at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn) and a member of [InternLM (书生·浦语)](https://github.com/InternLM) team. My research currently focuses on Large Language Models, with special interests in efficient post-training and self-alignmnet. And my research interests also include human-centric computer vision. I have been a core member of [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) since 2021, leading the development of [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose) and [MMAction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2).

Before joining Shanghai AI Laboratory, I was a research scientist at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com), working on environment perception for autonomous driving.

I received my Ph.D. degree from [MMLab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) in 2019, superviesd by Prof. [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/) and Prof. [Xiaoou Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qpBtpGsAAAAJ). Earlier I received my B.S. degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in 2014.
